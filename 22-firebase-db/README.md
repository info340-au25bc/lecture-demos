# Chat App (React) - Demo for class

This is a small React app scaffolded with Vite for demonstration in an introductory client-side web programming course. It intentionally includes 3-5 bugs for students to find and fix.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Notes:
- The app is intentionally small and contains a few bugs. Do not expect perfect behavior.
